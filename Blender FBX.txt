How to export .fbx from Blender:
In OpenGL coordinate system Z axis is forward/backward
In Blender Z axis is top/bottom

For Static objects:
 - Rotate all -90deg by X, Apply transformation, Rotate all +90deg by X
 - Transform: select "Apply Scalings" -> FBX All
 - Geometry: tick "Triangulate Faces" and "Tangent Space"

For Skinned object:
 - all previous for Static objects
 - set scale of Armature and Objects to 0.01 (Blender use meters vs FBX centimeters)
 - Armature: tick "Only Deform Bones", untick "Add Leaf Bones"

 Transparent Materials:
 - append/insert/prepend "AlphaClip" or "AlphaBlend" at the name of material
   (case doesn't matter)
 - set 'Alpha' value in the BSDF node manually (Inverted!)
